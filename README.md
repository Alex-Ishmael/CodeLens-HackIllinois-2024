## Inspiration
CodeLens was inspired by the need for a comprehensive tool that not only executes Linux commands and programs but also provides valuable insights, quick error fixes, and assistance for any project. The vision behind CodeLens is to simplify the command-line experience and enhance productivity by offering a seamless way to address errors, especially for developers with little prior development experience.

## What it does
CodeLens is a command-line companion that goes beyond execution. It provides detailed insights into the time taken, memory usage, and errors generated during command execution. Additionally, it employs AI to offer quick fixes and solutions for encountered errors, making it a valuable tool for developers seeking efficiency and reliability in their projects. It also keeps track of all the previous versions of your code so you can monitor how you improved the efficiency of your code.

## How we built it
CodeLens is built using Python. The core functionalities include command execution monitoring, error analysis, and integration with AI for error resolutions. The user-friendly interface ensures that developers can easily incorporate CodeLens into their workflow.

## Challenges we ran into
During the development of CodeLens, we faced challenges in integrating the Gemini AI model, extracting useful information from errors, and capturing performance tracking of the subprocess. Overcoming these hurdles required collaboration, innovation, and a dedication to delivering a robust solution in a short time.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to have created a tool that not only executes commands but also empowers developers with valuable insights and quick error resolutions. CodeLens stands as a testament to our commitment to enhancing the developer experience on the command line.

## What we learned
Throughout the development of CodeLens, we gained insights into how to monitor metrics of a process, and make good use of regular expressions, the steps to make use of powerful AI models in our project. These learnings contribute to our continuous improvement and fuel our passion for creating tools that make a meaningful impact.

## What's next for CodeLens
The journey for CodeLens doesn't end here. We plan to incorporate more features! We welcome contributions from the community to make CodeLens even more powerful and versatile.
